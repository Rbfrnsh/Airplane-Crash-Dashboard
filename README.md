[Airplane Crash Dashboard.pdf](https://github.com/Rbfrnsh/Airplane-Crash-Dashboard/files/12483777/Airplane.Crash.Dashboard.pdf)
this mini project to see information about Airplane crash case that happened throughout year 1918-2022
This dataset contains all of the plane crashes that happened throughout history. 
Data is extracted using web scraping methods in R and preprocessed to create an organized and informative dataset.

This is a sample dashboard that I made using PowerBI https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/12d62180-fa95-4005-940c-e1f76a28a921?ctid=69999de5-e28b-42a8-ab18-2d9de5d6c020&pbi_source=linkShare

If you're curious as to how airplane crashes have trended over the years, what concerns were addressed to mitigate these crashes, or how many crashes do we see happening in the next 5-10 years, then this dataset is a great place to start.
Note: This dataset is extracted in an excel format rather than a csv format due to the encoding issues found in some columns (e.g. location of the crash).
